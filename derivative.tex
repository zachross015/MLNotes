\subsection{Derivatives}

Let $f(x)$ be any continuous function. By finding the slope of the line between
the point $f(x)$ and some point a little further $f(x+h)$, we come up with the
\emph{rate of change} for the interval from $x$ to $x + h$, or simply the interval of $h$, using the slope
formula
\begin{equation}\label{eq:roc}
    \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}
\end{equation}
. We find the \emph{instantaneous rate of change of $f$ at $x$} by
narrowing the offset $h$ in Equation \ref{eq:roc} to an infinitely small
amount which is nearly 0. Extrapolating this idea to the rest of the domain that $x$
belongs to, we \emph{define the derivative of $f$ with respect to $x$ as the
instantaneous rate of change for all $x$ in the domain of $f$.}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:derivative}
    \dx[f] = \lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}
\end{equation}.

We will use a couple of alternate notations for the derivative
throughout the text
\begin{equation*}
    \dx f(x) \quad \text{or} \quad f'(x) \quad \text{or} \quad \dx[f]
\end{equation*}.

We will now define the nine rules by which most differentiation can be performed. Let $c_1$ and $c_2$ be constants, let $x$ and $y$ be variables, and let $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ both be continuous and real valued functions.

\begin{psec}{Constants}\label{rule:derivative constants} For constants,
    we have
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:derivative constant}
        \dx c_1 = 0
    \end{equation}
    . This is an intuitive consequence since a constant by definition does not
    change, and thus has no rate of change.

    If we differentiate a variable that does not change with respect to changes in our differentiating variable, then its derivative is treated as a constant. The same applies to a function. So the variable $y$ or $h(y)$ would, with respect to $x$, both have the derivatives
    \begin{equation*}
        \dx y = 0, \quad \quad \dx h(y) = 0
    \end{equation*} if and only if the variable $y$ is independent of $x$. This is once again an intuitive consequence since the variables will remain the same when $x$ is changed.

\end{psec}

\begin{psec}{Power rule}\label{rule:derivative powers} For any constant $c$ and
    variable $x$, we have
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:derivative power}
        \dx x^{c_1} = c_1 x^{(c_1 - 1)}
    \end{equation}
    . To understand this consider the case when $c_1=3$ so that $f(x) = x^3$. We have
    \begin{align*}
        \dx[f] &= \lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac{(x + h)^3 - x^3}{h} & &
        \text{\footnotesize by definition (\ref{eq:derivative})}\\
               &= \lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac{x^3 +3x^2h + 3xh^2 + h^3 -
               x^3}{h} & & \text{\footnotesize by expanding $(x + h)^3$}\\
               &= \lim_{h\rightarrow 0} 3x^2 + 3xh + h^2 & &
               \text{\footnotesize by cancellation}\\
               &= \lim_{h\rightarrow 0} 3x^2 & & \text{\footnotesize since $h\rightarrow 0$} \\
               &= 3x^2 & \text{}
    \end{align*}.

\subsection{Derivatives}

Let $f(x)$ be any continuous function. The \emph{rate of change in $f$ from $x$ to $x+h$} is the slope of the line between
the points $(x, f(x))$ and $(x + h, f(x+h))$, which can be written as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:roc}
    \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h} \quad .
\end{equation}
We then find the \emph{instantaneous rate of change of $f$ at the point $a$} by
narrowing the offset $h$ in Equation (\ref{eq:roc}) to an infinitely small
amount, nearly 0, at $(a, f(a))$.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:iroc}
    \dx[f] (a) = \lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac{f(a + h) - f(a)}{h} \quad .
\end{equation}
This is otherwise known as the slope of the line that runs tangent to $f(a)$.

By extrapolating Equation (\ref{eq:iroc}) to the rest of $f$'s domain, we define \emph{the derivative of $f$ with respect to $x$ as the
instantaneous rate of change for all $x$ in the domain of $f$}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:derivative}
    \dx[f] (x) = \lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h} \quad .
\end{equation}

We will use a couple of alternate notations for the derivative
throughout the text
\begin{equation*}
    \dx[f](x) \quad \text{or} \quad \dx f(x) \quad \text{or} \quad f'(x)
\end{equation*}, all of which represent the derivative of a function $f$ with respect to its input, $x$.

We will now define the nine rules by which most differentiation can be performed. Let $c_1$ and $c_2$ be constants, let $x$ and $y$ be variables, and let $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ both be continuous and real valued functions.

\begin{psec}{Constants}\label{rule:derivative constants} For constants,
    we have
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:derivative constant}
        \dx c_1 = 0
    \end{equation}
    . This is an intuitive consequence since a constant by definition does not
    change, and thus has no rate of change.

    If we differentiate a variable that does not change with respect to changes in our differentiating variable, then its derivative is treated as a constant. The same applies to a function. So the variable $y$ or $h(y)$ would, with respect to $x$, both have the derivatives
    \begin{equation*}
        \dx y = 0, \quad \quad \dx h(y) = 0
    \end{equation*} if and only if the variable $y$ is independent of $x$. This is once again an intuitive consequence since the variables will remain the same when $x$ is changed.

\end{psec}

\begin{psec}{Power rule}\label{rule:derivative powers} For any constant $c$ and
    variable $x$, we have
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:derivative power}
        \dx x^{c_1} = c_1 x^{(c_1 - 1)}
    \end{equation}
    . To understand this consider the case when $c_1=3$ so that $f(x) = x^3$. We have
    \begin{align*}
        \dx[f] &= \lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac{(x + h)^3 - x^3}{h} & &
        \text{\footnotesize by definition (\ref{eq:derivative})}\\
               &= \lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac{x^3 +3x^2h + 3xh^2 + h^3 -
               x^3}{h} & & \text{\footnotesize by expanding $(x + h)^3$}\\
               &= \lim_{h\rightarrow 0} 3x^2 + 3xh + h^2 & &
               \text{\footnotesize by cancellation}\\
               &= \lim_{h\rightarrow 0} 3x^2 & & \text{\footnotesize since $h\rightarrow 0$} \\
               &= 3x^2 & \text{}
    \end{align*}.

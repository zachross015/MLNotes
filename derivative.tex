\subsection{Finding extrema}
Let $f(x)$ be a continuous and differentiable function, or more simply, a function with no jumps, skips, or gaps. An example of this function might be $f(x)=x^2 - 9.44x + 20.79$ or simply $f(x) = 10$. In studying practical applications of math, we are often concerned with finding the \emph{maxima} and \emph{minima}, otherwise known as \emph{extrema}, in a function's range.

The practical applications of extrema are unlimited. When throwing a ball in the air, it's good to know what time it is heighest in the air as well as what that height is. When slowing down a car, we can use extrema to determine exactly how long it will take to reach a stop.

\begin{psec}{Addition and subtraction}

    \begin{equation}\label{eq:derivative add}
        \dx (f(x) + g(x)) = \dx[f] + \dx[g]
    \end{equation}

\end{psec}

\begin{psec}{Product rule}

    \begin{equation}\label{eq:derivative prod}
        \dx \left(f(x)*g(x)\right) = \dx[f] *  g(x) + f(x) *
        \dx[g]
    \end{equation}

\end{psec}

\begin{psec}{Chain rule}

    \begin{equation}\label{eq:derivative chain}
        \dx (f \circ g)(x) = \diff{f}{g} * \diff{g}{x}
    \end{equation}

\end{psec}

\begin{psec}{Quotient Rule} The quotient rule is just an extension of the
    power, product, and chain rules. We see this immediately since
    \begin{equation*}
        \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = f(x)g(x)^{-1}
    \end{equation*}
    . If we let $h(x) = x^{-1}$ so that $g(x)^{-1} = (h\circ g)(x)$, then we can expand out the product rule as
    in Equation (\ref{eq:derivative prod})
    \begin{equation*}
        \dx \left(f(x) * (h\circ g)(x)\right) = \dx[f] *  (h\circ g)(x) + f(x) *
        \dx\ [(h\circ g)(x)]
    \end{equation*}. We then use Equation (\ref{eq:derivative chain}) to expand out the
    derivative for the composite function $(h \circ g)(x)$
    \begin{equation*}
        \dx\ [(h\circ g)(x)] = \diff{h}{g} * \dx[g] = \left[\diff{}{g} g(x)^{-1}
        \right] * \dx[g]
    \end{equation*}. Equation (\ref{eq:derivative power}) tells us
    \begin{equation*}
        \diff{}{g} g(x)^{-1} = -g(x)^{-2}
    \end{equation*}. Putting all this together and simplifying, we end up with
    the formula
    \begin{equation}
        \dx \left(\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\right) = \frac{\dx[f] * g(x) - f(x) * \dx[g]
        }{g(x)^2}
    \end{equation}.

    \begin{equation}
        \dx c ^ {f(x)} = c ^ {f(x)} * \dx[f]

\begin{psec}{Logarithm rule}

    \begin{equation}
        \dx \log_c f(x) = \frac{1}{\ln c} * \frac{1}{f(x)} * \dx[f]
    \end{equation}

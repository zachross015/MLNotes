\section{Real Value Prediction}

For this section, our motivation is to construct an algorithm whose focus is
predicting a value. That is, we want a \emph{prediction function} which takes an
input, called a \emph{feature}, and produces some numeric reponse, called a
\emph{scalar response}, between $-\infty$ and $\infty$. As with the rest of
machine learning and with life itself, we \emph{learn} using experiences, or
features.
